I also write up a plan for the week, factoring in a couple buffer days towards the end to iron out any kinks in my work. But on a group project, planning looked different. We initially put together a plan in under two hours. Our wireframes were rough around the edges, but we all walked away thinking we were on the same page. That ended up not being the case...modals were moved, the home page took on a life of its own... We should have put more time into drawing out detailed wireframes.

The art of communication over Slack is one that must be honed; disappearing from your desk chair is tempting.
