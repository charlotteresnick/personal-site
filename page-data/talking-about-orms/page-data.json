Plus, SQL is a powerful language, thus SQL queries are as well; an ORM\\u2019s queries, oftentimes, will be better than those a novice SQL programmer wrote themselves.

Also, as cool as ORMs are, I think it\\u2019s important to truly understand the why. Would I use an ORM having little knowledge of databases and SQL? Probably not.
