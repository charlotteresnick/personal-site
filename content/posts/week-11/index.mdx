This week consisted of regular expressions, recursion, a hash table lesson, rails basics, another lesson on graphs, and a how-to on hooking up Rails to React.

Interested in the exact steps to create a React app that talks to your Rails app? You've come to the right place.

Here goes:

1. Create a React app client:

```
create-react-app client
```

2. Install the foreman gem (you only have to do this once!):

```
gem install foreman
```

3. Create a Procfile:

```
touch Procfile
```

4. Toss these lines in your Procfile:

```
web: cd client && npm start
api: bundle exec rails s -p 3001
```

5. Start foreman:

```
foreman start -p 3000
```

6. At this point, both of your servers should load - open up localhost:3000 and localhost:3001.

7. Working? Great. Now quit out of your servers.

8. In client/package.json, add a proxy:

```
"proxy": "http://localhost:3001/"
```

9. Start foreman again:

```
foreman start -p 3000
```

10. Now get to making fetch requests from the frontend to the backend!
