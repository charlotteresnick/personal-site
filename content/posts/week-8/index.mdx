Two months down, one to go!

Time has flown and we're kicking off Project Three next week. This week brought with it lessons about React prototypes, lifting state, React routes, and React app building exercises done alone and in groups because Project Threeâ€™s our first group project.

One of the above mentioned solo app building exercises was a weather app. Using the Open Weather Map API, I set out to create a react app in the likeness of this in a mobile view:

And this in desktop:

Given a zip code, a GET request is made to fetch weather data from the API, returning the respective city name, current temperature, short weather description, min. temp, and max. temp.

Take a look at my full repo [here](https://github.com/charlotteresnick/weather-app).
