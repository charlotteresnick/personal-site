How is it almost the end of project week already? Despite having only two weeks under my belt, I’m pleasantly surprised by how much I know. The weird thing is, I feel about 80% lost when I’m working on my homework at night--referring back to notes, watching class recordings, googling--and then the next day it’s like I totally get it, like everything makes sense? Weird, but I’ll take it.

What I thought was going to be a fairly simple game to implement started out to be much harder than I had anticipated. But, after some reading, I was able to nail down the algorithm and logic behind the snake (in my game, a caterpillar) moving and losing the game. Instead of the snake chasing a dot per the classic version, my caterpillar eats a variety of randomly generated fruits (from an array of fruit images I made).

I’m looking forward to presenting on Monday and think my project is going to be one of the stronger amongst the group. Here’s a [link](https://github.com/charlotteresnick/caterpillar) to my repo. And here's a look at the three levels:

Easy:
