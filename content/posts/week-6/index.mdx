I’ve been in full project mode all week and got a chance to really flex my SQL muscles again when I was creating a dropdown button that would display a user’s collections on the bottom of a queried drink recipe. It seemed easy in theory and proved a lot harder in execution. Here’s what I was going for:

This recipe wasn’t saved to any of a user’s collections, so every collection the user had created showed in the dropdown. But when it is added to one, the collection disappears from the dropdown. Simple, right? The query doesn’t look so simple and was a bit of a monster to write.

Here’s a [link](https://blooming-journey-07077.herokuapp.com/) to the app on Heroku. To check out my code on Github, click [here](https://github.com/charlotteresnick/Drink-Finder).
