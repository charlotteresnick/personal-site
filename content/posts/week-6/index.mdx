I’ve been in full project mode all week and got a chance to really flex my SQL muscles again when I was creating a dropdown button that would display a user’s collections on the bottom of a queried drink recipe. It seemed easy in theory and proved a lot harder in execution. Here’s what I was going for:

I've searched for an Old Fashioned recipe and found one! But when I click the + button at the bottom of the recipe, I have nowhere to save it because I haven't created a collection yet.

<img
  src="/images/drinkfinder.png"
  alt="Empty collections dropdown menu"
  width="100%"
/>

And look at that! Now that I have a collection set up and this recipe isn't in it, the name's rendering in the dropdown!

<img
  src="/images/drinkfinder1.png"
  alt="Populated collections dropdown menu"
  width="100%"
/>

I gave the collection name a click and viola! The recipe has been saved and I can take a look at it whenever I'd like.

<img src="/images/drinkfinder2.png" alt="Recipe in collection" width="100%" />

Simple, right? The query doesn’t look so simple and was a bit of a monster to write.

```js {4-12}
static getByUserIdAndDrinkId(user_id, drink_id) {
    return db
    .query(`
    SELECT id, name, bool_or(drink_exists) as "drink_exists" FROM
      (SELECT c.id, c.name,
        CASE WHEN s.drink_id = $1
          THEN TRUE
          ELSE FALSE
        END drink_exists
      FROM collections c LEFT JOIN saves s on s.collection_id = c.id
      WHERE c.user_id = $2) as saves
    GROUP BY saves.id, saves.name;
    `, [drink_id, user_id])
    .then((collections) => collections.map((collection) => new this(collection)));
  }
```

And that's that! Here’s a [link](https://blooming-journey-07077.herokuapp.com/) to the app on Heroku. To check out my code on Github, click [here](https://github.com/charlotteresnick/Drink-Finder).
