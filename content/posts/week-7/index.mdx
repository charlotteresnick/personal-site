This week was all about React. We covered off on some basic whiteboarding problems, building a recipes app, creating some website mockups, forms, yarn versus npm, state and useState, React hooks, as well as components and props.

Up until this point, I had heard that React is like a bulldozer compared to the technologies I had been using until now. I didn’t get it. Now I do.

My React-Is-Indeed-A-Bulldozer aha moment went as follows: one of our morning exercises was to build a stoplight, a task I was required to complete in JavaScript as part of my application for General Assembly and something I genuinely struggled with at the time (it also took the better part of an afternoon). And I did it this time around in React, in 15 minutes. Plus I did all of the styling. And it wasn’t that hard? Bizarre. Bulldozer, I got it.

Give my stoplight a go:

```js react-live
function App() {
  const [selectedLight, setSelectedLight] = React.useState("stop")

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: "flex",
        flexDirection: "row",
        height: "400px",
        justifyContent: "center",
      }}
    >
      <ButtonPannel setSelectedLight={setSelectedLight} />
      <Stoplight selectedLight={selectedLight} />
    </div>
  )
}

function ButtonPannel(props) {
  const { setSelectedLight } = props
  const buttonStyle = {
    width: "100px",
    height: "40px",
    fontSize: "20px",
    backgroundColor: "lightslategray",
    color: "white",
    border: "lightslategray",
    borderRadius: "10px",
    marginRight: "10px",
  }
  return (
    <div
      style={{
        height: "350px",
        width: "100px",
        display: "flex",
        flexDirection: "column",
        justifyContent: "space-evenly",
        alignItems: "center",
      }}
    >
      <button style={buttonStyle} onClick={() => setSelectedLight("stop")}>
        Stop
      </button>
      <button style={buttonStyle} onClick={() => setSelectedLight("slow")}>
        Slow
      </button>
      <button style={buttonStyle} onClick={() => setSelectedLight("go")}>
        Go
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}

function Stoplight(props) {
  const { selectedLight } = props
  const lightStyle = {
    height: "100px",
    width: "100px",
    border: "2px solid black",
    borderRadius: "50px",
  }
  console.log(selectedLight)
  const stop = (
    <div
      style={{
        ...lightStyle,
        backgroundColor: selectedLight === "stop" ? "red" : "gray",
      }}
    ></div>
  )
  const slow = (
    <div
      style={{
        ...lightStyle,
        backgroundColor: selectedLight === "slow" ? "yellow" : "gray",
      }}
    ></div>
  )
  const go = (
    <div
      style={{
        ...lightStyle,
        backgroundColor: selectedLight === "go" ? "green" : "gray",
      }}
    ></div>
  )

  return (
    <div
      style={{
        display: "flex",
        flexDirection: "column",
        justifyContent: "space-evenly",
        alignItems: "center",
        height: "350px",
        width: "150px",
        backgroundColor: "lightslategrey",
        border: "lightslategrey",
        borderRadius: "40px",
        marginLeft: "10px",
      }}
    >
      {stop}
      {slow}
      {go}
    </div>
  )
}

render(<App />)
```
