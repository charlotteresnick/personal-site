Hi! Thanks for checking out my blog.

I’m Charlotte, a San Francisco-based new grad with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from the University of Miami. And I’m starting General Assembly’s 12-week Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp this week. And I decided to blog about it! And I’m equal parts terrified...excited...and anxious.

A little about me; I was born in Los Angeles, grew up in Colorado, highschool-ed in San Diego and spent my undergrad years in Portland, Oregon, San Francisco, and Miami. Wow. San Francisco became home again after graduation in December. Unfortunately, I was laid off at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and found myself with a lot of free time.

A couple bad days led to some serious reflection, journaling, and conversations. I realized that what initially seemed like a dose of bad luck was perhaps an opportunity in disguise. My previous position wasn’t fulfilling, wasn’t something I could have seen myself doing for the foreseeable future, and just didn’t feel right. I had dabbled with different programming languages between an undergrad course, a weekly summer class at a San Francisco hackerspace, and online tutorials--and I loved it. But I always saw it as a supplement to my degree (big symbolic and formal logic gal here), and definitely never thought it would be something that I’d consider pursuing as a career. Because, after all, I didn’t major in computer science and was certain that that was the only way to break into the field.

But my free time was short lived; I picked up my laptop and decided to give programming another go. A couple courses and lots of reading later, I decided to research bootcamps and chose General Assembly. Fast-forward through more preparation, pre-work, and nerves and here I am! Ready to get bootcamping and excited about what my new future as a software engineer has in store.

Stay tuned! Plan’s to post on Fridays.
