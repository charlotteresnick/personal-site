This week was a breeze! Mostly review of the pre-work - some CSS, HTML and JavaScript. Git commands are tricky. I made a lot of mistakes, pushed my work to goodness-knows-where, and have more practice to do with it going into the weekend.

Growing up, snacktime after every first day of school consisted of fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies and milk at the kitchen counter. It’s a family tradition courtesy of my parents and I’ve stuck with it since highschool. I baked a couple I had in the freezer, ended up eating the ones my Dad sent me instead, and thought about childhood last day of school snack (ice cream, always Baskin Robbins; another tradition I’ve stuck with).

Bootcamp Day One felt so different from every other first day; I rolled out of bed at 6:30, put on sweatpants and signed on to Zoom just before 7:00. But some things hadn’t changed, I was still just as nervous and shy. And I was just as excited to get started with coursework.

I’m feeling good after this week. That may be, in part, because it’s the first week and I had reviewed CSS, HTML as well as some basic JavaScript before bootcamp started. I won’t question it. We covered off on Flexbox today, which I thought was super cool and started writing some basic functions. Next week’s a deeper dive into JavaScript and I’m really looking forward to it.
