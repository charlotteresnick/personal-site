Hi!

I’m Charlotte, a San Francisco-based new grad with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from the University of Miami.

I was born in Los Angeles, grew up in Colorado, highschool-ed in San Diego and spent my undergrad years in Portland, Oregon and Miami. San Francisco was home after Freshman year when I took a year off to be with family when my mom was sick and became home again after graduation in December.

I was laid off at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and found myself with a lot of free time. A couple bad days led to some serious reflection, journaling, and conversations. I realized that what initially seemed like a dose of bad luck was perhaps an opportunity in disguise. My previous position wasn’t fulfilling, wasn’t something I could have seen myself doing for the foreseeable future, and just didn’t feel right. I had dabbled with different programming languages between an undergrad course, a weekly summer class at a San Francisco hackerspace, and online tutorials - and I loved it. But I always saw it as a supplement to my degree (big symbolic and formal logic gal here), and definitely never thought it would be something that I’d consider pursuing as a career. Because, after all, I didn’t major in computer science and was certain that that was the only way to break into the field.

But my free time was short lived; I picked up my laptop and decided to give programming another go.

Quick Facts:

- I'm a yoga instructor! I spent a little over a month in India working on my certification. Check out my [site](https://www.charlotteresnickyoga.com/)!
- I was a coxswain for the women's rowing team at Lewis & Clark College my Freshman year, later coxing at ZLAC Rowing Club and S.D.R.C. in San Diego, CA.
- Cheez-Its and ice cream really make my world go round.
