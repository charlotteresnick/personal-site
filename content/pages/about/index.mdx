Hi!

I’m Charlotte, a San Francisco-based new grad with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy from the University of Miami.

I was born in Los Angeles, grew up in Colorado, highschool-ed in San Diego and spent my undergrad years in Portland, Oregon and Miami. San Francisco was home in 2017 and has been since December 2019.

Quick Facts:

- I'm a yoga instructor! I spent a little over a month in India working on my certification. Check out my [site](https://www.charlotteresnickyoga.com/)!
- I was a coxswain for the women's rowing team at Lewis & Clark College my Freshman year, later coxing at ZLAC Rowing Club and S.D.R.C. in San Diego, CA.
- Cheez-Its and ice cream really make my world go round.
